The [register repository](https://github.com/iso24229/register) — the
authoritative source of the register data — now provides:

- **One JSON Schema per item class** (`schema/authority.schema.yaml`,
  `schema/system-code.schema.yaml`, etc.), stored in YAML format for
  consistency with the data.
- **A validator** (`scripts/validate.mjs`) that runs `ajv` against
  every entry on every push and pull request. Continuous integration
  fails on any schema mismatch.
- **Interactive submission forms** at
  [/about/apply/submit](/about/apply/submit) for proposing a new system,
  and [/about/apply/submit-authority](/about/apply/submit-authority) for
  proposing a new authority.

## Schema highlights

- The `authority` schema enforces the operational requirement that
  every authority designates exactly two authorised persons (per
  Annex A.4).
- The `system-code` schema enforces the four-segment colon-form code
  pattern (`titular:source:target:identifying`) from §4 of the standard.
- The `spelling-system` schema requires both an ISO 639 language code
  and an ISO 15924 script code; a bare script code is not a spelling
  system (see [/learn/glossary](/learn/glossary)).

## Submission process

Proposals must include the source and target ISO 639 and ISO 15924
codes (validated client-side in the interactive form), a defining
reference, at least three independent demonstrative sources, and a
justification. The Advisory Group reviews submissions at its bimonthly
meeting.
